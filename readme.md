# xcode-toolbox
A CLI tool which aims to provide a convenient operation toolbox on XCode project. It's faster and cleaner than `xed`. You can use it to:

    (1) Open XCode project or workspace. 
    (2) Remove project's derived data, or just the Build or Index folder.
    (3) [WIP] Force kill XCode process. 
    (4) [WIP] Generate Objective-C function signatures.

The argument `path` is a path to the directory containing at least 1 `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file, default 
to the current directory. `.xcworkspace` has higher priority than `.xcodeproj`.

Options:
  --rm-all    Remove the project's derived data in
              ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData.

  --rm-build  Similar to --rm-all, but only remove the `Build` subdirectory.
  --rm-index  Similar to --rm-all, but only remove the `Index` subdirectory.
  --help      Show this message and exit.

git clone git@github.com:SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git ~/GitHub
xc ~/GitHub/SDWebImage/Examples
```
2. open project/workspace of current folder without parameters
```shell

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zlrs/xcode-opener/master/install.sh | sudo zsh
```

# Todo features
- [ ] toolbox subcommands
    - [ ] `kill` subcommand. To kill all running XCode processes, equivalent to the following shell command. 
    ```shell
    kill $(ps aux | grep 'Xcode' | awk '{print $2}')
    ```
    - [ ] `find` subcommand. Find a source file/project file(s) under the given directory tree. 
    - [ ] generate Objective-C method signature.
- [x] clear XCode project index folder
- [x] clear XCode project derivedData folder
